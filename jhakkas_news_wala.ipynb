Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.'s \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon's Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was \\\"committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.\\\"In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors \\\"for not reporting environmental information.\\\" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm's board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become \\\"net zero carbon across their businesses\\\" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a \\\"transparency website\\\" which it uses to report on what it describes as its \\\"sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance.\\\" The site also has information on the firm's carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \\\"100 percent clean energy.\\\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs \\\"long-term renewable energy contracts.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 581,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cnbc, Articles, Politics, source:tagname:The New York Times\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"header_image\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 479,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103807719-GettyImages-578137340.jpg?v=1529472215\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"raw_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 594,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<div class=\\\"group\\\"><p>China's retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. </p><p>Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July.

The dollar totals don't include spinoffs and repurchases. This week's M&A deals include BHP Billiton's  $39 billion hostile bid for Potash , announced earlier this week.BHP is hoping to win over regulators before approaching Potash shareholders, after the board of the Canadian-fertilizer company rejected BHP's bid.

It will feature rides based on the French company's popular  franchises, such as Rayman Raving Rabbids.  The project is being led by Ubisoft Motion Pictures, the  company's film and TV division, which has partnered with  Malaysian theme park developer RSG.  \\\"Together, we are creating a place where every guest is a player,  every ride is a playground, every visit is a game,\\\" Jean de  Rivieres, senior vice-president of Ubisoft Motion Pictures, said  in a press release on Monday.   RSG has already co-developed another theme park in Malaysia,  called Movie Animation Park Studios.  \\\"In RSG, we've found a partner with a successful track record in  working with international brands, a shared ambition to design  the family destination of the future and a wealth of expertise in  theme park development,\\\" said de Rivieres.   Ubisoft's park will not be the first video game-based theme park.  Angry Birds Land (based on the popular mobile game developed by  Finnish company Rovio Entertainment) opened in 2012 in Finland  and the U.K. also hosts an Angry Birds Activity Park.

To get people onto its mail-delivery service, PillPack needs patients to switch from their existing pharmacy, which often means transferring prescriptions from CVS or Walgreens, the two largest chains in the U.S.But PillPack has run into a significant roadblock in getting those transfers approved. CVS and Walgreens are rejecting an increasing number of their requests, claiming that PillPack isn't getting proper consent from patients. PillPack says it always gets patient approval before making transfer requests and blames the pharmacy giants for unfairly refusing to honor them, sometimes hanging up on PillPack's pharmacists or throwing the request forms in the trash.\\\"While incumbent pharmacies may be disappointed in the loss of business, it is unacceptable to make unsubstantiated allegations about PillPack's practices while simultaneously creating systemic barriers that make it harder for a customer to switch pharmacies,\\\" PillPack spokeswoman Jacquelyn Miller told CNBC.The conflict has continued to escalate, with a source familiar with the matter telling CNBC that Amazon is documenting all cases of refused transfers. The incumbents are unwilling to roll over for Amazon in a market where a single customer, who often has chronic conditions and requires regular refills, can represent thousands of dollars of revenue a year through copayments and insurance coverage.PillPack, a licensed pharmacy service in 49 of 50 states, launched in 2014 with a service that neatly packages, labels and delivers medications every month with free shipping. CVS has followed with its own multi-dose packaging option for patients who need help taking multiple medications. Walgreens also has a home delivery program.The intensifying spat over transfers offers a window into the larger challenge Amazon faces as it tries to mimic its e-commerce playbook in the prescription medication world, where spending in the U.S. is approaching $500 billion a year. The company is already battling Surescripts, an e-prescribing network part-owned by CVS and Express Scripts, over a patient data dispute. Last month, Surescripts threatened to cut off a contract with a third party called ReMy Health, which gave PillPack access to data about patient prescription histories, and said it would turn the case over to the FBI.CVS says it's not indiscriminately rejecting transfer orders, but rather is calling patients when a request is submitted to make sure the customer has asked for it. Many of these patients are older and unfamiliar with the new world of online shopping and mobile apps.The pharmacies say they're only denying transfers when patients tell them they never signed up for PillPack or have never even heard of it. The issue can be particularly challenging for people with dementia who may not have intended to sign up or not remembered doing so. Brian Caswell, the owner of Wolkar Drug in Kansas, said he's called patients about PillPack requests only to have them deny ever providing consent.\\\"Could they have clicked on something online and forgot about it?\\\" Caswell said. \\\"It's possible.\\\"There could also be patients who did request a transfer to PillPack but are embarrassed to admit it when their pharmacist calls for confirmation.The fight with the big pharmacies began almost immediately after Amazon announced the PillPack acquisition in June 2018, for $753 million (though the price wasn't disclosed until later). A month after the deal, CVS sent a cease-and-desist letter to PillPack's lawyers, and Walgreens sent a strongly-worded warning in August, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not be named because the letters were confidential.Both CVS and Walgreens confirmed that they reached out to PillPack but didn't specify the exact nature of the correspondence.\\\"We've communicated our concerns directly to PillPack,\\\" a Walgreens spokesperson said. \\\"We respect our patients' privacy rights, and strongly believe that patients are entitled to, and benefit from a personal and trusted relationship with their pharmacist.\\\"A CVS spokesperson said that while it's \\\"common practice\\\" for pharmacists to legitimately request prescription transfers from its pharmacies, the company \\\"notified PillPack to stop any activity to initiate prescription transfers without the informed consent of our pharmacy patients.\\\"PillPack responded at the time to both CVS and Walgreens, denying that the company was doing anything wrong.Here's how a transfer works. A CVS or Walgreens customer sees a PillPack ad on television or online and pulls up the PillPack website or calls a company representative. By phone, PillPack says, patients are asked explicitly if they give the company consent to transfer prescriptions from their current pharmacy. From the website, the patient fills out personal information, includes relevant prescriptions and then clicks a blue button to complete the signup.Just below the blue button, here's what the fine print says:\\\"By clicking the 'Finish Signing Up' button above, you consent to PillPack transferring your prescriptions from your existing pharmacies to PillPack and/or contacting your doctors to request new prescription and refills.\\\"From there, a PillPack representative calls or faxes the existing pharmacy and requests the transfer. It's a straightforward process that happens all the time when patients move or when they're traveling and need to pick up a refill before returning home. In the U.S., there are federal and state laws that, with some exceptions, require pharmacists to transfer prescription information to another pharmacy.However, PillPack said its pharmacists began reporting challenges with patient transfer requests in the weeks after the acquisition was announced. Additionally, the company said it heard reports in July 2018, that CVS hosted a training session for pharmacists, informing them that they should not transfer to PillPack until after they notified patients about the company's rival service.CVS told CNBC that, starting last year, it recommended its pharmacists check in with customers following a PillPack transfer request after hearing a series of complaints about the company's practices. CVS also said representatives tell customers about the company's own mail-order service but that its pharmacies will facilitate a transfer to PillPack if the patient still wants it.CVS and Walgreens aren't the only pharmacies concerned about PillPack's actions. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents U.S. pharmacy owners and is one of the owners of Surescripts, said his team has heard from 20 to 30 pharmacists who said they were concerned after patients told them they never authorized transfers to PillPack. Pharmacists have also been vocal on internet forum Reddit, where in several threads some have admitted that they automatically throw PillPack faxes \\\"in the shred bin,\\\" or call patients to get confirmation.Update: This story was updated to say that the National Community Pharmacists Association is a part owner of Surescripts.WATCH: How Amazon could change the pharmacy businessFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.As Amazon bolsters its PillPack business to take on the prescription drug market, industry stalwarts CVS and Walgreens are vigorously defending their turf, setting up a protracted battle between the old guard and the new.Amazon bought internet pharmacy PillPack last year, a deal that sent shares of pharmacy companies tumbling.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for \\u201cevolution\\u201d, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn\\u2019t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I\\u2019ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn\\u2019t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you\\u2019re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What\\u2019s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have \\u2014 backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of perfect for us,\\u201d said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. \\u201cEducational content is core to our DNA, and we\\u2019re unencumbered \\u2014 unlike traditional textbook publishers, we\\u2019re not defending a dying business.\\u201d Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms \\u2014 turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media\\u2019s own business models. \\u201cWe think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,\\u201d Chase Carey, News Corporation\\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be \\u201cthrilled\\u201d if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. \\u201cOver the last 10 years alone, we\\u2019ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,\\u201d said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world\\u2019s largest education and learning company. \\u201cOne way to describe it would be an act of \\u2018creative destruction.\\u2019 By this I mean we\\u2019re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.\\u201d On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position \\u2014 senior vice president for learning \\u2014 with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company\\u2019s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education \\u2014 namely what some rivals refer to as the \\u201cFoxification\\u201d of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery\\u2019s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company\\u2019s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation\\u2019s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. \\u201cWhen big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,\\u201d said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \\u201cYou have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?\\u201d Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery\\u2019s education unit, says in his company\\u2019s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo \\u201clost a lot of money,\\u201d but said that Discovery\\u2019s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel\\u2019s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery\\u2019s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn\\u2019s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has \\u2014 iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). \\u201cAs a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,\\u201d said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. \\u201cBut I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.\\u201d (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery\\u2019s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company\\u2019s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit\\u2019s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. \\u201cTelevision is always going to be our primary focus, but we\\u2019re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEducation is an area of solid, sustainable growth.\\u201dAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have \\u2014 backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times\",\n          \"Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash\\u2014start banking your body.

A depositor at Sc\\u00e9il will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take \\\"a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,\\\" Choulika  said. \\\"Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore.\\\" (He was visiting Sc\\u00e9il's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   \\\"It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.\\\"  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in \\\"a very large  sample,\\\" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three \\\"very large\\\" batches and stored in Sc\\u00e9il  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though \\\"it's never too late,\\\" Choulika  said.  The technology that Sc\\u00e9il uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells\\u2014the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body\\u2014could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  \\\"That was the paradigm,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,\\\" \\\"The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.\\\"  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that \\\"intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells\\\" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.\\\"With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.\\\"At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic \\\"Blade  Runner,\\\" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware \\u2014 which looks like a futuristic smart necklace \\u2014 sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.\\\"Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,\\\" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. \\\"Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.\\\"It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies \\u2014 and governments \\u2014 have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance,\\u00a0developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a \\\"game changer\\\" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.\\\"We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,\\\" he said. \\\"All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.\\\"\\\"Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,\\\" he said. \\\"Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.\\\"Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.\\\"The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,\\\" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a \\\"temperature screening solution only.\\\"\\\"The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,\\\" said Sheehan. \\\"The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.\\\"But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone \\\"may not be very effective.\\\"And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.\\\"There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,\\\" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. \\\"It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.\\\"The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a \\\"hybrid\\\" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 \\u2014 Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home \\\"forever.\\\"According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.\\\"If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,\\\" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app \\u2014 a rival to Slack and Teams \\u2014 told CNBC. \\\"I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.\\\"Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country.\\u00a0New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.\\\"This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,\\\" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.\\\"Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,\\\" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.\\\"That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce \\u2014 not take away completely \\u2014 but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.\\\"As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn\\u2019t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I\\u2019ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn\\u2019t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you\\u2019re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What\\u2019s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.\\\"Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,\\\" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.\\\"Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,\\\" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement. \\\"Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.\\\"cnbc, Articles, World economy, Technology, Terrorism, Cybersecurity, Jobs, World Economy, Business News, Economy, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL Article 2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html\",\n          \"https://www.cnbc.com/2012/02/15/retailer-grows-up-along-with-his-business.html\",\n          \"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/here-are-the-top-10-major-worries-for-global-business-leaders-right-now-according-to-wef.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article 3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware \\u2014 which looks like a futuristic smart necklace \\u2014 sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.\\\"Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,\\\" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. \\\"Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.\\\"It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies \\u2014 and governments \\u2014 have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance,\\u00a0developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a \\\"game changer\\\" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.\\\"We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,\\\" he said. \\\"All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.\\\"\\\"Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,\\\" he said. \\\"Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.\\\"Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.\\\"The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,\\\" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a \\\"temperature screening solution only.\\\"\\\"The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,\\\" said Sheehan. \\\"The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.\\\"But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone \\\"may not be very effective.\\\"And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.\\\"There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,\\\" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. \\\"It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.\\\"The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a \\\"hybrid\\\" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 \\u2014 Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home \\\"forever.\\\"According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.\\\"If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,\\\" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app \\u2014 a rival to Slack and Teams \\u2014 told CNBC. \\\"I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.\\\"Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country.\\u00a0New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.\\\"This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,\\\" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.\\\"Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,\\\" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.\\\"That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce \\u2014 not take away completely \\u2014 but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.\\\"As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have \\u2014 backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of perfect for us,\\u201d said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. \\u201cEducational content is core to our DNA, and we\\u2019re unencumbered \\u2014 unlike traditional textbook publishers, we\\u2019re not defending a dying business.\\u201d Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms \\u2014 turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media\\u2019s own business models. \\u201cWe think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,\\u201d Chase Carey, News Corporation\\u2019s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be \\u201cthrilled\\u201d if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. \\u201cOver the last 10 years alone, we\\u2019ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,\\u201d said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world\\u2019s largest education and learning company. \\u201cOne way to describe it would be an act of \\u2018creative destruction.\\u2019 By this I mean we\\u2019re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.\\u201d On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position \\u2014 senior vice president for learning \\u2014 with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company\\u2019s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education \\u2014 namely what some rivals refer to as the \\u201cFoxification\\u201d of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery\\u2019s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company\\u2019s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation\\u2019s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. \\u201cWhen big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,\\u201d said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \\u201cYou have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?\\u201d Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery\\u2019s education unit, says in his company\\u2019s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo \\u201clost a lot of money,\\u201d but said that Discovery\\u2019s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel\\u2019s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery\\u2019s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn\\u2019s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has \\u2014 iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). \\u201cAs a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,\\u201d said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. \\u201cBut I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.\\u201d (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery\\u2019s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company\\u2019s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit\\u2019s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. \\u201cTelevision is always going to be our primary focus, but we\\u2019re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEducation is an area of solid, sustainable growth.\\u201dAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have \\u2014 backing from a traditional educational publisher.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   \\\"Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,\\\"  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   \\\"But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.\\\"  Mathias added that it was \\\"too soon\\\" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but \\\"it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.\\\"  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise \\\"a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety\\\".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  \\\"It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   \\\"Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,\\\"  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   \\\"But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.\\\"cnbc, Articles, Alphabet Class A, Technology, Tech Transformers, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source\",\n          \"Ford, Amazon, Subway and History Channel Generate Most BuzzFord, Amazon, Subway and the History Channel  are the  \\\"buzziest\\\" brands in the United States, according to the latest  bi-annual list from YouGov's BrandIndex.

In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Sc\\u00e9il's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is \\\"a one-time payment, for your life.\\\"  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  \\\"It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,\\\" Choulika  said. \\\"We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,\\\" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Sc\\u00e9il will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take \\\"a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,\\\" Choulika  said. \\\"Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore.\\\" (He was visiting Sc\\u00e9il's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   \\\"It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.\\\"  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in \\\"a very large  sample,\\\" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three \\\"very large\\\" batches and stored in Sc\\u00e9il  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though \\\"it's never too late,\\\" Choulika  said.  The technology that Sc\\u00e9il uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells\\u2014the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body\\u2014could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  \\\"That was the paradigm,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,\\\" \\\"The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.\\\"  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that \\\"intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells\\\" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.\\\"With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,\\\" Choulika said. \\\"You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.\\\"At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic \\\"Blade  Runner,\\\" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.\\u2014By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash\\u2014start banking your body.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I\\u2019d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson \\u2013 based in the UK\\u2013 have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don\\u2019t really need me to identify new problems \\u2013 they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it\\u2019s worth talking about. Here\\u2019s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it\\u2019s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world\\u2019s biggest exporter. And it\\u2019s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we\\u2019re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there\\u2019s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I\\u2019ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians\\u2019 thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I\\u2019m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It\\u2019s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It\\u2019s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don\\u2019t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too \\u2013 as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants \\u2013 such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders \\u2013 existing banks or new entrants \\u2013 to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies \\u2013 both small and large \\u2013 need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company\\u2019s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government\\u2019s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson\\u2019s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology \\u2013 fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That\\u2019s the point about R&D: we\\u2019re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There\\u2019s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster \\u2013 we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce \\\"bomber\\\" bottles.  \\u2014  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  \\\"We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,\\\" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. \\\"They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.\\\"  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   \\\"Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,\\\" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. \\\"As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.\\\"The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  \\\"Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,\\\" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via \\\"craft carts,\\\"  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.\\\"You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!\\\" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?
