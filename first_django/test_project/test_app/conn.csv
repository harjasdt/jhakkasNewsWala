Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said.

1,1,Heather Black,edwardrichard@example.org,"['Science', 'Entertainment', 'Business']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/08/20/media-companies-seeing-profit-slip-push-into-education.html,"Retailer Grows Up, Along With His Business34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here.cnbc, Articles, Business News, Small Business, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/02/15/retailer-grows-up-along-with-his-business.html,"Research and Markets: Movies & Entertainment in the United States: Current Market Size and Forecasts to 2016DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3clwfc/movies_and)      has announced the addition of the ""Movies      & Entertainment in the United States"" report to their      offering.

If people don't know the business exists, they won't  walk through the doors—and a business location, staff and  start-up capital become irrelevant points.  Publicity can be acquired with billboard space or TV commercials,  but many small businesses just don't have that kind of money. For  mom and pops, a little creativity and a flair for the theatrical  can go a long way. In short, they need to rely on good  old-fashioned, attention-grabbing publicity stunts.  Some businesses have seen stunts become catalysts that take them  to the next level. Others see efforts fizzle out, and in some  cases turn into horrific disasters. But while there's no  guarantee a publicity stunt will accomplish what it's designed to  do, many businesses take that route anyway, always hoping for the  best.  Here's a list of businesses that engaged in noteworthy plays for  the public's attention. Some of these businesses used promotions  that exceeded expectations. Other businesses made headlines and  were soon forgotten, and others were unmitigated calamities. But  whatever the case, all these businesses deserve credit for trying  to do something a little different.  Read ahead to see our list of outrageous publicity stunts engaged  in by small businesses over the  years.By Daniel BukszpanUpdated 06 June 2013Every January, select New Yorkers brave the elements to  participate in the No Pants Subway Ride, an event staged by the  Improv Everywhere prank collective. Participants board the subway in  the middle of winter sans pants, to the great amusement of  surprised onlookers.This event presented the hair removal salon Shobha with a unique opportunity to  publicize their service. In January, The Manhattan-based salon sent a team of  pants-free participants to the event in underwear proudly bearing  the Shobha name.Many small businesses promote their services with prizes and  giveaways. Dating services are no exception, including Gotham  Dating Partners, which  offers a unique promotional item to new clients purchasing an  annual membership—a handgun.""We direct them to online sites and pay for the purchase,"" Gotham  Dating Partners CEO Aaron Fraser said in an e-mail. While clients are  required to pass background checks in order to be eligible for weapons, the site proudly matches gun enthusiasts.Rotterdam tattoo artist Dex Moelker caused a stir in 2011, when she gave a client a unique tattoo. The  client got the profile pictures of all 152 of her Facebook friends tattooed on her right arm, a process documented in a  YouTube video that went viral.Disappointingly, it was revealed by the Dutch newspaper Telegraaf  to be nothing more than a temporary tattoo. ""It is a try out tattoo, a transfer that washes off in a couple  of days,"" Moelker told the Telegraaf. However, the video has been  viewed more than 3.7 million times and is linked to from  Moekler's website, a testament to its publicity value two years  after the fact.  One of the most profitable movies ever made is 1999's ""The Blair  Witch Project,"" which had a production budget of $60,000 and a  worldwide box office take of over $248 million, according to  Box Office Mojo. The film was a fictional account of three film students'  experience investigating a centuries-old tale about a  witch.  ""The film was intended to be a fake documentary,"" co-director Daniel Myrick told Entertainment  Weekly. The movie was publicized a year in advance by  its website, which featured faked police reports  and staged interviews with ornery townsfolk. The advance  publicity fueled a widespread public perception and confusion  that the film was comprised of real footage, which only led both  horror fans and curiosity-seekers to purchase tickets in  droves.Cashtomato.com was a short-lived Internet video site whose founder allegedly intended that it compete with YouTube. A tall order, and one  that was addressed in a 2008 publicity stunt. It involved dressing up three representatives as tomatoes and having  them distribute $4,000 in cash to a packed mid-afternoon crowd in  Manhattan's Union Square. What could go wrong?The representatives were besieged by a seething mob of 100 people, who grabbed at the cash, injuring someone in the process,  according to the New York Daily News. Ultimately, the publicity stunt did not have the desired effect,  and the Cashtomato.com domain name is available for purchase  today.The German publishing house Eichborn Verlag performed an  attention-getting stunt at the 2009 Frankfurt Bookfair. Their  logo features a housefly, and the company harnessed the power of  the insect by attaching promotional banners to real live ones and  letting them loose in the venue.A video of the publicity event can be seen on YouTube. Witness the looks of simultaneous delight and irritation among attendees.LifeLock is an identity theft prevention company that used an  audacious tactic to publicize its services in 2007. It ran  television commercials in which CEO Todd Davis disclosed his real  social security number, a dare to identity thieves to  try their luck against the company.  One year later, ABC News reported that criminals did exactly that  by taking out a $500 payday loan in the CEO's name. It wasn't the only time either. In 2010, the Phoenix New Times  reported that his identity had been stolen a whopping 13 times.Half.com is an online seller of new and used goods founded in  1999 and purchased in 2000 by eBay. Unlike its parent company,  Half.com is not the place to outbid others for rare collectibles, but  rather a place to buy goods outright at fixed prices.In order to attract attention during its pre-eBay days, the company  paid the city of Halfway, Ore. $100,000 to change its name to  Half.com for one year. It also donated 20 new computers to the city to sweeten the deal  for its 362 citizens.  Syracuse, N.Y. is home to an ice hockey team known as The Crunch.  In December 2011, the team offered a spot on their roster to NBA player Kris  Humphries, who is perhaps best known as the man who was Kim  Kardashian's husband for all of 72 days.  As a tribute to Humphries' recently collapsed nuptials, the team  offered fans the chance to buy six tickets for $72, and Syracuse  Crunch General Manager Vance Lederman made a statement on the team's official website to make  the athlete feel welcome. ""Being from Minnesota, Humphries will  surely enjoy the hockey and feel right at home in the cold, gray,  dismal weather we experience this time of year in Central New  York,"" he said.

In the past 10 years, he's successfully turned around over  100 companies.  Now he's bringing those skills to CNBC and  doing something no one has ever done on TV before … he's  putting over $2 million of his own money on the line. In  each episode, Lemonis makes an offer that's impossible to refuse;  his cash for a piece of the business and a percentage of the  profits.  And once inside these companies, he'll do almost  anything to save the business and make himself a profit; even if  it means firing the president, promoting the secretary or doing  the work himself.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said.

""There is going to be an economy around it.

He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things.

2,2,Anthony Barker,ismith@example.net,"['Entertainment', 'Sports', 'Technology']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/08/20/media-companies-seeing-profit-slip-push-into-education.html,"Crypto investor who bought Beeple's NFT for $69 million says he would have paid even moreThe buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink.

Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it.

He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow.

But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said.

""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""

For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

4,4,Deanna Moon,samuelrodriguez@example.com,"['Technology', 'Science', 'Business']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said.

He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

5,5,Robert Crane,debbieyates@example.org,"['Technology', 'Science', 'Health']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.cnbc, Articles, Transportation, Computer hardware, Real estate, Jobs, Economy, Enterprise, Technology, Vodafone Group PLC, Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, General Motors Co, Siemens AG, Airbus SE, BT Group PLC, Ocado Group PLC, Twitter Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Hardware, Workplace Revolution, Business News, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html,"Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash—start banking your body.

Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks.

6,6,Monica Jenkins,brooksstacey@example.com,"['Sports', 'Technology', 'Business']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here.cnbc, Articles, Business News, Small Business, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/02/15/retailer-grows-up-along-with-his-business.html,"What's On: Big Retailers, Big Caps and Big TobaccoHere's what's up on Wednesday's Squawk on the Street: --Big name retailers are set to report.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things. But I won't be selling it anytime soon.""The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.  U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.

""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy.

8,8,Jacqueline Williams,khopkins@example.org,"['Science', 'Health', 'Technology']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said.

A man called the program and said that some of these surveys which claim scientific support for the global warming hypothesis, contained some decidedly unclimatolgical signatures from pediatricians, gynecologists or just about anybody else with a terminal degree. In other words the case against oil was a little slipperier than reported. “Gynecologists against drilling?”, I thought, “Seems like there must be some kind of conflict of interest here. I need to learn more.” Googling ‘gynecologist’ and ‘warming’ is an adventure in itself, but eventually I found a report by the National Center Policy Analysis which indeed found such signatures on a letter released by Ozone Action, and widely circulated in the media. (See Bowyer's take on oil in the video).Who am I to judge the scientific case for global warming? I have barely any more experience in climatology than I do in gynecology, although I am an eager student in both. However, it seems to me that the incredibly obvious point of weakness in the public policy argument is blindingly obvious.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

9,9,Edward Oliver,brianbarron@example.net,"['Sports', 'Technology', 'Business']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack.

According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

10,10,Kimberly Stevens,opace@example.net,"['Entertainment', 'Science', 'Business']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

If people don't know the business exists, they won't  walk through the doors—and a business location, staff and  start-up capital become irrelevant points.  Publicity can be acquired with billboard space or TV commercials,  but many small businesses just don't have that kind of money. For  mom and pops, a little creativity and a flair for the theatrical  can go a long way. In short, they need to rely on good  old-fashioned, attention-grabbing publicity stunts.  Some businesses have seen stunts become catalysts that take them  to the next level. Others see efforts fizzle out, and in some  cases turn into horrific disasters. But while there's no  guarantee a publicity stunt will accomplish what it's designed to  do, many businesses take that route anyway, always hoping for the  best.  Here's a list of businesses that engaged in noteworthy plays for  the public's attention. Some of these businesses used promotions  that exceeded expectations. Other businesses made headlines and  were soon forgotten, and others were unmitigated calamities. But  whatever the case, all these businesses deserve credit for trying  to do something a little different.  Read ahead to see our list of outrageous publicity stunts engaged  in by small businesses over the  years.By Daniel BukszpanUpdated 06 June 2013Every January, select New Yorkers brave the elements to  participate in the No Pants Subway Ride, an event staged by the  Improv Everywhere prank collective. Participants board the subway in  the middle of winter sans pants, to the great amusement of  surprised onlookers.This event presented the hair removal salon Shobha with a unique opportunity to  publicize their service. In January, The Manhattan-based salon sent a team of  pants-free participants to the event in underwear proudly bearing  the Shobha name.Many small businesses promote their services with prizes and  giveaways. Dating services are no exception, including Gotham  Dating Partners, which  offers a unique promotional item to new clients purchasing an  annual membership—a handgun.""We direct them to online sites and pay for the purchase,"" Gotham  Dating Partners CEO Aaron Fraser said in an e-mail. While clients are  required to pass background checks in order to be eligible for weapons, the site proudly matches gun enthusiasts.Rotterdam tattoo artist Dex Moelker caused a stir in 2011, when she gave a client a unique tattoo. The  client got the profile pictures of all 152 of her Facebook friends tattooed on her right arm, a process documented in a  YouTube video that went viral.Disappointingly, it was revealed by the Dutch newspaper Telegraaf  to be nothing more than a temporary tattoo. ""It is a try out tattoo, a transfer that washes off in a couple  of days,"" Moelker told the Telegraaf. However, the video has been  viewed more than 3.7 million times and is linked to from  Moekler's website, a testament to its publicity value two years  after the fact.  One of the most profitable movies ever made is 1999's ""The Blair  Witch Project,"" which had a production budget of $60,000 and a  worldwide box office take of over $248 million, according to  Box Office Mojo. The film was a fictional account of three film students'  experience investigating a centuries-old tale about a  witch.  ""The film was intended to be a fake documentary,"" co-director Daniel Myrick told Entertainment  Weekly. The movie was publicized a year in advance by  its website, which featured faked police reports  and staged interviews with ornery townsfolk. The advance  publicity fueled a widespread public perception and confusion  that the film was comprised of real footage, which only led both  horror fans and curiosity-seekers to purchase tickets in  droves.Cashtomato.com was a short-lived Internet video site whose founder allegedly intended that it compete with YouTube. A tall order, and one  that was addressed in a 2008 publicity stunt. It involved dressing up three representatives as tomatoes and having  them distribute $4,000 in cash to a packed mid-afternoon crowd in  Manhattan's Union Square. What could go wrong?The representatives were besieged by a seething mob of 100 people, who grabbed at the cash, injuring someone in the process,  according to the New York Daily News. Ultimately, the publicity stunt did not have the desired effect,  and the Cashtomato.com domain name is available for purchase  today.The German publishing house Eichborn Verlag performed an  attention-getting stunt at the 2009 Frankfurt Bookfair. Their  logo features a housefly, and the company harnessed the power of  the insect by attaching promotional banners to real live ones and  letting them loose in the venue.A video of the publicity event can be seen on YouTube. Witness the looks of simultaneous delight and irritation among attendees.LifeLock is an identity theft prevention company that used an  audacious tactic to publicize its services in 2007. It ran  television commercials in which CEO Todd Davis disclosed his real  social security number, a dare to identity thieves to  try their luck against the company.  One year later, ABC News reported that criminals did exactly that  by taking out a $500 payday loan in the CEO's name. It wasn't the only time either. In 2010, the Phoenix New Times  reported that his identity had been stolen a whopping 13 times.Half.com is an online seller of new and used goods founded in  1999 and purchased in 2000 by eBay. Unlike its parent company,  Half.com is not the place to outbid others for rare collectibles, but  rather a place to buy goods outright at fixed prices.In order to attract attention during its pre-eBay days, the company  paid the city of Halfway, Ore. $100,000 to change its name to  Half.com for one year. It also donated 20 new computers to the city to sweeten the deal  for its 362 citizens.  Syracuse, N.Y. is home to an ice hockey team known as The Crunch.  In December 2011, the team offered a spot on their roster to NBA player Kris  Humphries, who is perhaps best known as the man who was Kim  Kardashian's husband for all of 72 days.  As a tribute to Humphries' recently collapsed nuptials, the team  offered fans the chance to buy six tickets for $72, and Syracuse  Crunch General Manager Vance Lederman made a statement on the team's official website to make  the athlete feel welcome. ""Being from Minnesota, Humphries will  surely enjoy the hockey and feel right at home in the cold, gray,  dismal weather we experience this time of year in Central New  York,"" he said. Tune in to """" on CNBC Prime, Tuesdays at 9 p.m.  ET  When Marcus Lemonis isn't running his multi-billion dollar  company, Camping World, he goes on the hunt for struggling  businesses that are desperate for cash and ripe for a deal. In the past 10 years, he's successfully turned around over  100 companies.  Now he's bringing those skills to CNBC and  doing something no one has ever done on TV before … he's  putting over $2 million of his own money on the line. In  each episode, Lemonis makes an offer that's impossible to refuse;  his cash for a piece of the business and a percentage of the  profits.  And once inside these companies, he'll do almost  anything to save the business and make himself a profit; even if  it means firing the president, promoting the secretary or doing  the work himself.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said.

While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it.

He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things.

11,11,Christopher Murray,arthurmorgan@example.com,"['Sports', 'Technology', 'Health']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

Of the four so-called FANG stocks, three are reporting this week: Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon. Google parent company Alphabet's quarterly earnings report could be a bellwether for technology stocks, according to one trader. Advertising revenue for Alphabet could indicate if ad dollars are also flowing into smaller, tech companies.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.  ""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.

So when Amazon launched its DeepLens camera in November 2017, he got the idea to use its artificial intelligence software to do just that. Ahead of the device's official launch later this week, he attended a hackathon on his own time to build a system that records a user's experiences and recognizes the person right in front of them. ""I wanted to find a way to use the device to help out someone who is struggling,"" he said.  DeepLens is Amazon's equivalent of Google's Clips ""smart"" camera, but it's targeted to developers instead of consumers. The idea is to use artificial intelligence technology to make it easier for the camera to do things like recognize objects or characters that appear in a video stream.Solkhan is hoping that people experiencing memory loss will someday carry around the camera with them wherever they go. Here's how it would work: The DeepLens system would store photographs and names of a user's family and friends in Amazon's cloud service. The camera would then record interactions. And if it all goes right, the AI would then recognize the person and issue a verbal prompt. Solkhan is testing it out with friends and family members as a side project. In recent years, Amazon has increasingly been looking for ways to use tools like artificial intelligence in health care for people with complex medical needs. The company isn't alone. Apple and Alphabet also see opportunities in health, a $3 billion sector that lags far behind other industries in adopting technology.""We see a lot of usage for machine learning from primary care to medical screening,"" Amazon's machine learning and AI general manager, Matt Wood, said in an interview with CNBC. Wood said the camera literally put Amazon's advanced technology, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, into the hands of developers. He described some of the first applications as ""fun,"" like recognizing species of pet dogs. But others are targeted to helping seniors and people with serious medical problems, like Solkhan's device. ""We're motivated to use it (machine learning) to improve elder care, and care in general,"" he said.Sachin Solkhan, a veteran software engineer who works with Fidelity Investments, has thought a lot about how technology can help people with dementia recognize their loved ones.

12,12,Tammy Richardson,aaron67@example.com,"['Sports', 'Science', 'Entertainment']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/08/20/media-companies-seeing-profit-slip-push-into-education.html,"Retailer Grows Up, Along With His Business34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.  ""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.  ""UConn's women's program is always good, and the men's basketball  program has been good for the past 20 years.

Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   ""Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,"" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. ""As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.""The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via ""craft carts,""  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

Email us at  consumernation@cnbc.com.The Seattle Mariners may not win Major League Baseball's Western  Division this year but there is one category where they can  challenge any team in baseball: beer variety at the ball park.  Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.cnbc, Articles, Food and drink, Molson Coors Beverage Co, Food and Beverage, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Business News, Retail, Consumer Goods, Consumer Nation, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2013/04/22/beer-choice-matters-for-seattle-mariners-fans.html,"Poll: Which is your favorite major tech stock reporting earnings this week?Some of the biggest technology names on Wall Street are set to announce earnings this week that could potentially bring the tech sector's rally to a crashing halt.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.cnbc, Articles, Transportation, Computer hardware, Real estate, Jobs, Economy, Enterprise, Technology, Vodafone Group PLC, Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, General Motors Co, Siemens AG, Airbus SE, BT Group PLC, Ocado Group PLC, Twitter Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Hardware, Workplace Revolution, Business News, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html,"Ford, Amazon, Subway and History Channel Generate Most BuzzFord, Amazon, Subway and the History Channel  are the  ""buzziest"" brands in the United States, according to the latest  bi-annual list from YouGov's BrandIndex.

14,14,Mrs. Dawn Solis DVM,melissavelazquez@example.com,"['Sports', 'Science', 'Entertainment']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.  ""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.  ""UConn's women's program is always good, and the men's basketball  program has been good for the past 20 years. They're both blue-blood college basketball programs.""—By CNBC's Adam MolonFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.

Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   ""Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,"" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. ""As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.""The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via ""craft carts,""  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

Email us at  consumernation@cnbc.com.The Seattle Mariners may not win Major League Baseball's Western  Division this year but there is one category where they can  challenge any team in baseball: beer variety at the ball park.  Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.cnbc, Articles, Food and drink, Molson Coors Beverage Co, Food and Beverage, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Business News, Retail, Consumer Goods, Consumer Nation, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2013/04/22/beer-choice-matters-for-seattle-mariners-fans.html,"Poll: Which is your favorite major tech stock reporting earnings this week?Some of the biggest technology names on Wall Street are set to announce earnings this week that could potentially bring the tech sector's rally to a crashing halt.

15,15,Todd Martin,phillipssteven@example.org,"['Sports', 'Technology', 'Business']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things. But I won't be selling it anytime soon.""The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

16,16,John Bell,joegoodwin@example.com,"['Sports', 'Science', 'Business']","Retailer Grows Up, Along With His Business34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here.cnbc, Articles, Business News, Small Business, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/02/15/retailer-grows-up-along-with-his-business.html,"Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

(Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.

Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

I’ve actually never talked to O’Neil, but I’ve often been surprised to hear they were long gone from (or certainly cautious on) some of the biggest momentum names when the market — or at least a cluster of names — has appeared to have gotten out of control. That’s when companies go from being just companies to being stocks. With that in mind, what’s the current state of momentum? Depends when you ask. “The first thing we always look at is the direction of the market, and it’s unclear at this point.” Chris Gessel, executive editor of IBD, has worked with O’Neil for 15 years and serves as the front man to people like me. We were talking late Tuesday morning — and at that point he was saying: It’s a good time to be cautious buying stocks. “There are some opportunities, but we’re heading into a market that isn’t as clear as we’d like.” But that shouldn’t be surprising: Historically, according to the O’Neil archives, the third year of a recovery after a major bear market tends to be choppy. Growth stocks tend to be more exaggerated in their ties to the market. If the market is down 10%, they’ll be down 20% and 30%. (And vice-versa.) This is a very news-driven market, but even that statement is confusing. “In a strong bull market, no matter what the news, the market goes higher.” Yet in the world of O’Neil, the market is in an intermediate correction. “Historically, you would expect to see choppy sideways action, and that’s what we’re getting.” The indexes are not looking well – certainly not as good as the leading stocks. “Either the market has to catch up or the stocks have to give up gains.” Looming earnings adds another dimension of uncertainty. “If the market were much stronger, you wouldn’t have to worry about earnings, but we have the mixed message of the market indexes and leading stocks.

I’ve actually never talked to O’Neil, but I’ve often been surprised to hear they were long gone from (or certainly cautious on) some of the biggest momentum names when the market — or at least a cluster of names — has appeared to have gotten out of control. That’s when companies go from being just companies to being stocks. With that in mind, what’s the current state of momentum? Depends when you ask. “The first thing we always look at is the direction of the market, and it’s unclear at this point.” Chris Gessel, executive editor of IBD, has worked with O’Neil for 15 years and serves as the front man to people like me. We were talking late Tuesday morning — and at that point he was saying: Enter later in the afternoon, after the market closed.

17,17,Bobby Ford,jessicajackson@example.com,"['Entertainment', 'Business', 'Technology']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/08/20/media-companies-seeing-profit-slip-push-into-education.html,"The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

18,18,Beth Foley,qsmith@example.com,"['Health', 'Science', 'Sports']","Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.  ""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.  ""UConn's women's program is always good, and the men's basketball  program has been good for the past 20 years. They're both blue-blood college basketball programs.""—By CNBC's Adam MolonFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.

A man called the program and said that some of these surveys which claim scientific support for the global warming hypothesis, contained some decidedly unclimatolgical signatures from pediatricians, gynecologists or just about anybody else with a terminal degree. In other words the case against oil was a little slipperier than reported. “Gynecologists against drilling?”, I thought, “Seems like there must be some kind of conflict of interest here. I need to learn more.” Googling ‘gynecologist’ and ‘warming’ is an adventure in itself, but eventually I found a report by the National Center Policy Analysis which indeed found such signatures on a letter released by Ozone Action, and widely circulated in the media. (See Bowyer's take on oil in the video).Who am I to judge the scientific case for global warming?

The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.

""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   ""Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,"" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. ""As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.""The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via ""craft carts,""  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

19,19,Jasmine Marshall,michael25@example.net,"['Sports', 'Health', 'Science']","Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.

Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said.

A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality.

""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight.

A man called the program and said that some of these surveys which claim scientific support for the global warming hypothesis, contained some decidedly unclimatolgical signatures from pediatricians, gynecologists or just about anybody else with a terminal degree. In other words the case against oil was a little slipperier than reported. “Gynecologists against drilling?”, I thought, “Seems like there must be some kind of conflict of interest here. I need to learn more.” Googling ‘gynecologist’ and ‘warming’ is an adventure in itself, but eventually I found a report by the National Center Policy Analysis which indeed found such signatures on a letter released by Ozone Action, and widely circulated in the media. (See Bowyer's take on oil in the video).Who am I to judge the scientific case for global warming? I have barely any more experience in climatology than I do in gynecology, although I am an eager student in both. However, it seems to me that the incredibly obvious point of weakness in the public policy argument is blindingly obvious.

Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   ""Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,"" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. ""As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.""The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via ""craft carts,""  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

20,20,Tammy Gray,markbanks@example.com,"['Entertainment', 'Technology', 'Sports']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things. But I won't be selling it anytime soon.""The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink.

And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality.

""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984.

""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

21,21,Kevin Austin,florescolleen@example.com,"['Sports', 'Science', 'Health']","Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash—start banking your body.  Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

The site is called Blood, Sweat & Cheers, or BSC. The motto: bring back recess. Every day the site sends out emails to subscribers highlighting fun, offbeat, sometimes sweat inducing activities. This is no Groupon deal where you get half off on a massage. First, there are no coupons — yet. And BSC is trying to find the most unique, offbeat activities possible, like ""a muddy obstacle course race"", ""Marathon Training Made Fun, Social and Easy"", ""Bingo at the Standard Hotel"", or ""The Ugly Dog Pageant."" Put me down for the last one. The site launched in April just for New York but will go national later this month. How will Blood, Sweat & Cheersmake money?

In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact.

Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

22,22,Robert Hickman II,cheryldillon@example.org,"['Entertainment', 'Technology', 'Science']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.cnbc, Articles, Transportation, Computer hardware, Real estate, Jobs, Economy, Enterprise, Technology, Vodafone Group PLC, Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, General Motors Co, Siemens AG, Airbus SE, BT Group PLC, Ocado Group PLC, Twitter Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Hardware, Workplace Revolution, Business News, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html,"UK MPs call for AI commission to tackle the ‘Star Wars’-style futureThe U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.  U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said.

Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company.cnbc, Articles, Technology, source:tagname:The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2012/08/20/media-companies-seeing-profit-slip-push-into-education.html,"Retailer Grows Up, Along With His Business34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders. Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.  ""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.

Thanks to the efforts of Safeco Field stadium concessionaire  Centerplate, fans attending a Mariners game can choose from more  than 50 different varieties of beer sold on draft, in bottles and  even limited-release, 22-ounce ""bomber"" bottles.  —  The beer list at Safeco is simply a reflection of the culture of  the Pacific Northwest, Centerplate said. The Mariners play in  Seattle, and Washington State has more than 150 different  breweries.  ""We have a unique demographic that's very highly educated about  beer,"" said Steve Dominguez, Centerplate general manager. ""They  tell us what they are looking for and we seek to meet that demand  with the right variety of flavors.""  While a beer list boasting more than 50 options for any one game  is impressive, dig a little deeper and it's clear just how  serious the Mariners and Centerplate take their beer offerings.  As the weather changes during the months-long Major League seball  season, so too do the beer offerings.   ""Attend a game in April or May when the weather is still cold and  damp and the list will be full of IPA's,"" said Adrian Dishington, Centerplate regional vice president, referring to India Pale Ales, which tend to have a stronger hops flavor. ""As the season  moves into the warmer months, we'll be offering more Hefeweizens (wheat-based beers) and lighter beers. Toward the end of the season, as the weather  turns colder again, we'll be more focused on heavy and heartier  beers, more Oktoberfest's, things like that.""The Safeco beer list is mix of big national brands like  MillerCoors and small local favorites like Fremont Brewery and  Skagit River Brewery.  (Read More: The World's Best Beers) While MillerCoors is the main beer sponsor at Safeco, Centerplate  officials said the conglomerate has no problem sharing the stage  with the region's smaller brewers. In fact, Dominguez said MillerCoors uses Safeco to showcase the  variety in its beer portfolio by offering the usual ballpark  staples like Miller Lite and Coors Light, as well as beers from  its craft beer division, which includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel and Batch  19. While MillerCoors may have deep pockets, that's not the case with  a majority of the brewers found at the stadium.  ""Ninety-nine percent of the beers on our list don't pay to play,"" said Dishington.While breweries like Elysian Brewing and Silver City may be  smaller in size, they are not small in impact. Centerplate  officials said craft beer brands outsell the larger domestic  brands by a four-to-one ratio.(Read More: CNBC Beer Label Madness Champion Crowned) Fans can expect to pay the typical ballpark premium when buying a  craft beer: a 12-ounce craft draft costs $7.75, a 20-ounce craft  draft $9.75 and a 22- to 24-ounce bomber bottle costs $11.50.Much of the beer in the ball park is sold via ""craft carts,""  the 25  beer carts located throughout the stadium, which sell these specialty brews. Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

Retail is just one part of the business. He also engages the community through events such as art openings, film premieres, and skate competitions at the Seattle headquarters. Evo, short for “evolution”, is how Phillips thinks about his business: always changing to stay relevant. And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri34-year-old professional skier Bryce Phillips had a vision to create a retail experience for the active sport enthusiast that would embrace their lifestyle and their values.In 2005, he launched Evo, an online and brick-and-mortar retail business that caters to skiers and boarders.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.cnbc, Articles, Transportation, Computer hardware, Real estate, Jobs, Economy, Enterprise, Technology, Vodafone Group PLC, Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, General Motors Co, Siemens AG, Airbus SE, BT Group PLC, Ocado Group PLC, Twitter Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Hardware, Workplace Revolution, Business News, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html,"Research and Markets: Movies & Entertainment in the United States: Current Market Size and Forecasts to 2016DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3clwfc/movies_and)      has announced the addition of the ""Movies      & Entertainment in the United States"" report to their      offering.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984. Boston College reportedly saw a dramatic  increase in applications for the following academic year.

And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

26,26,Crystal Cabrera,shannon83@example.com,"['Health', 'Sports', 'Technology']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

Using a technology that echoes science fiction movies, a French company is offering people a ""bank"" to store  their own stem cells for years in a bet that those cells may be used to grow replacement organs and possibly  save their lives someday.  ""It's a personal deposit of your cell,"" said Dr. André  Choulika, CEO of the biotech company Cellectis, which  is launching the stem-cell bank known  as Scéil this month.  Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.  ""This pace of science currently goes so fast, probably in a few  years, less than 10 years, everyone will have their own cell  backup, and it will be a requirement,"" said Choulika, whose  company is named after the Gaelic word for ""story,"" and is  pronounced ""sail"" by Choulika.   ""We believe that regenerative medicine is the future,"" he   said.   In the present, though, it is anything but  cheap. Scéil's services cost $60,000, Choulika said,  adding that it is ""a one-time payment, for your life.""  (Read more: Hot biotech  IPOs)  Choulika said he expects enthusiastic adoption by wealthy  clients, as has been seen with other new technologies.  Then, system improvements and competition could drive the  initial price down considerably.  ""It's expensive, or it seems expensive, for one reason,"" Choulika  said. ""We don't know how many people are going to sign up,  and it's a very complex and sophisticated technology,"" he said. The number of people now who could both afford the  process and be interested in trying it might top 1 million.The company says it has already signed customers, though it doesn't wish to reveal details about them. Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.Forget about cash—start banking your body.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

Ask UConnFor the second time in 10 years, the University of Connecticut is  sending both its men's and women's basketball teams to the NCAA finals.  And that means this year's Huskies  squads are again likely to be a boon for the university and its bottom line.  ""It's infinitely priceless,"" said Mike Enright, associate  director of athletics for communications at UConn, referencing  the Huskies' Final Four appearances. ""It brings great notoriety  for the teams, but it also brings great notoriety for the  university."" Read MoreBoston's Green Monster  goes digital with selfies  Enright said that based on observation from the 2004 season, when  the Huskies sent both teams to the Final Four and won both  championship titles, higher merchandise sales on items like T-shirts and caps will likely be one of the most tangible effects  of the increased attention.  ""We saw a doubling of our money resulting from the licensing of  our goods,"" he said. ""We doubled it from approximately half a  million to $1 million.""  Next season's ticket sales and prices could also see a boost,  said Chris Matcovich, vice president of data and communications  at TiqIQ.  ""You'll see an initial bump at the beginning of the season for  early conference matchups,"" said Matcovich. ""It definitely  increases the level of enthusiasm.""  There may also be an increase in financial contributions from  alumni, said UConn's Enright. The school currently has an annual  athletics budget of $62 million.  Winning brackets may even translate into a larger applicant  pool, he said.  ""We always look at athletics as the front door for UConn,"" said  Enright. ""We hope that through this a lot of people learn about  our university.""  However, David Carter, professor of sports business at the University of Southern California's  Marshall School of Business, cautions that any  basketball-generated spike in university applications may come  with a question mark attached to its quality. Read MoreThere's no paternity  in baseball!  ""You sit back and wonder, 'Gee, if that spike is due to athletic  performance, are these students really academically inclined?'""  said Carter. ""These may not be the kinds of students that these  universities really want, and that's a concern that a lot of  schools have.""  For UConn, though, such concerns would likely be minor, said Patrick Rishe, associate professor of economics at Webster  University. While UConn's tournament wins may boost  application numbers slightly, the university won't likely  experience the kind of boost that universities with lower  profiles have generated through unexpected athletic  success.   ""These spikes are probably going to be larger for schools that  have not had that level of success previously,"" said Rishe. ""For  instance, the University of Dayton reached the Elite Eight. You  would expect schools like that to have spikes because many had  not heard of them before.""Read More  Spikes in university applications and enrollment stemming from  athletics has become known as the ""Flutie effect,"" originating  with the stunning, Doug Flutie-led football victory for Boston  College over the defending national champions, the Miami  Hurricanes, in 1984.

""The Flutie effect only happens when you have a school that is a  true Cinderella story, like Butler, George Washington, and VCU,""  said Rishe, referencing tournament underdogs from recent years.

So when Amazon launched its DeepLens camera in November 2017, he got the idea to use its artificial intelligence software to do just that. Ahead of the device's official launch later this week, he attended a hackathon on his own time to build a system that records a user's experiences and recognizes the person right in front of them. ""I wanted to find a way to use the device to help out someone who is struggling,"" he said.  DeepLens is Amazon's equivalent of Google's Clips ""smart"" camera, but it's targeted to developers instead of consumers. The idea is to use artificial intelligence technology to make it easier for the camera to do things like recognize objects or characters that appear in a video stream.Solkhan is hoping that people experiencing memory loss will someday carry around the camera with them wherever they go. Here's how it would work: The DeepLens system would store photographs and names of a user's family and friends in Amazon's cloud service. The camera would then record interactions. And if it all goes right, the AI would then recognize the person and issue a verbal prompt. Solkhan is testing it out with friends and family members as a side project. In recent years, Amazon has increasingly been looking for ways to use tools like artificial intelligence in health care for people with complex medical needs. The company isn't alone. Apple and Alphabet also see opportunities in health, a $3 billion sector that lags far behind other industries in adopting technology.""We see a lot of usage for machine learning from primary care to medical screening,"" Amazon's machine learning and AI general manager, Matt Wood, said in an interview with CNBC. Wood said the camera literally put Amazon's advanced technology, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, into the hands of developers. He described some of the first applications as ""fun,"" like recognizing species of pet dogs. But others are targeted to helping seniors and people with serious medical problems, like Solkhan's device. ""We're motivated to use it (machine learning) to improve elder care, and care in general,"" he said.Sachin Solkhan, a veteran software engineer who works with Fidelity Investments, has thought a lot about how technology can help people with dementia recognize their loved ones.

27,27,Shelley Jacobs,nmann@example.com,"['Health', 'Science', 'Technology']","The gadgets and software that could help us return to the officeAs employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.cnbc, Articles, Transportation, Computer hardware, Real estate, Jobs, Economy, Enterprise, Technology, Vodafone Group PLC, Microsoft Corp, Zoom Video Communications Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, General Motors Co, Siemens AG, Airbus SE, BT Group PLC, Ocado Group PLC, Twitter Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Hardware, Workplace Revolution, Business News, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/the-gadgets-and-software-that-could-help-us-return-to-the-office.html,"Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure Forget about cash—start banking your body.

Those clients will be putting down a hefty sum on a  bet that that outlay will be more than offset by the benefits  realized from scientific breakthroughs in coming decades.  A depositor at Scéil will make an appointment with a  dermatologist, who will take ""a small puncture out of your skin,  under the arm, 3 millimeters in diameter,"" Choulika  said. ""Then the sample is shipped to our treatment center,  which is located in Singapore."" (He was visiting Scéil's facility there when he spoke to CNBC.com in a phone interview.)  (Read more: We  Americans are healthy, really!)  The skin cells are grown in the lab and genetically manipulated  with enzymes in a way that reverts them to a stem-cell  state.   ""It's like a computer that you want to reboot, and you want to  rewrite the hard drive all in zeros,"" Choulika said. ""The cells  totally forget what they are, and go back to 'stage zero' in  life.""  Then those stem cells are themselves grown in ""a very large  sample,"" he said. Afterward, the cultivated stem cells are  split into three ""very large"" batches and stored in Scéil  locations in Singapore, Switzerland and Dubai. The separation  acts as a fail-safe measure.  Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks.

28,28,April Smith,shoffman@example.org,"['Technology', 'Business', 'Entertainment']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty. And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place.

He said the rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, herald a new era where technology has allowed artists and collectors around the world to buy and sell art more easily and democratically.""This NFT is a significant piece of art history,"" Sundaresan said. ""Sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize. I'm OK with that. I had the opportunity to be part of this very important shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.""NFTs have exploded in recent months, as NBA video highlights, memes, digital art and even a tweet sell for six or seven figures. While proponents say NFTs, which assign ownership of any digital asset on the blockchain, will not only change the art world but could be applied to physical goods like homes and property. Sales of NFTs have now topped $500 million, according to many estimates.""There are going to be hundreds of thousands of people from around the world who are going to adopt this medium, a digitally native medium to monetize art,"" Sundaresan said. ""There is going to be an economy around it. ""He said that while the art world has been the exclusive purview of wealthy, largely white Western collectors and artists for centuries, NFTs have allowed ""artists in the Philippines, Thailand, or India now to make their first $1,000 or $500 on the internet.""Sundaresan declined to say exactly how much he was prepared to pay for the work. He said he knew going into the Christie's auction that ""it would be competitive"" and had a ceiling price in mind that was higher than the $69.3 million he paid.""We did have a higher limit,"" he said. ""I was very motivated and ready to go beyond even what we paid for it.""Sundaresan said he has been investing in cryptocurrencies and cryptocompanies since 2013. He said he started ""with no money"" and began working for cryptocompanies and was able to invest early in fast-growth companies that have grown up around the cryptoeconomy. He declined to say how much he's worth on paper ""since it depends on the cryptomarket.""He said he has invested in not just bitcoin and Ethereum, but also blockchain network Polka Dot and Flow. He said he's doesn't think crypto will face a ban from regulators or central banks.""If regulators were tighter in previous years, that would have stifled innovation. I think we're at a point where they see the positive impacts of crypto around the world.""When asked what his $69 million Beeple could be worth in a year or even 10 years, Sundaresan said he had no plans to sell it. But he hinted he may find ways to ""monetize it"" by either offering pieces of it or displaying it in a virtual museum.""The piece is going to take on a life of its own, that's what makes NFTs really interesting,"" he said. ""It may not just be a piece of art, it can become thousands of other things. But I won't be selling it anytime soon.""The buyer of the $69 million NFT by the artist Beeple said he was prepared to bid even higher, since it will be seen by history as the starting point of a new age of digital art.In his first television interview, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has no regrets paying $69 million for what many say is simply a JPEG and an hyperlink.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

""Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures.""Results from the survey found that respondents across North America, East Asia and Pacific regions were most concerned by cyber attacks and asset bubbles.Meanwhile, unemployment, fiscal crises and the failure of a nation's government to provide stability are the top three risks facing businesses globally,The data from the Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) survey, drawn from over 12,411 executives across 136 countries was conducted earlier this year between February and June. The survey asked respondents to identify the five biggest risks to doing business in their respective countries. The risks identified were spread across economic, geopolitical, social and technological areas that could impact the functioning of corporates over the next 10 years.Some of the other risks identified by the respondents included energy price shock, profound social instability, failure of financial mechanism or institution, failure of critical infrastructure, inter-state conflict and terrorist attacks.""Whilst economic growth and technological developments create new opportunities for business and countries, geopolitical risks and events have led to uncertainties which raise questions about how to manage resilience in uncertain times,"" John Scott, chief risk officer of commercial insurance at Zurich, said in a press statement.Scott further explained that looking at the survey results, it appears that in the medium-term, business leaders are focusing on social and economic risks but it is important to remain prepared for any environmental and technological risks as well.In terms of regions, while business leaders in Europe highlighted the failure of financial mechanisms or institution as pressing risks, in South Asia, failure of urban planning and failure of critical infrastructure were marked among the key potential threats.Respondents across North America, the Middle East and Northern Africa were seen to be worried about a threat of potential terrorist attack. Meanwhile, risks associated with the failure of climate change adaptation saw very little concern among respondents. According to the results, only Canadian executives put climate change in their top risks.Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.""Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk,"" John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement.

I identify a problem and develop a solution. I’d like to think that the success of companies like Dyson – based in the UK– have helped the country in more than a few ways, including boosting its exports and tax revenues. Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

29,29,Jose Bryant,hughesmaurice@example.com,"['Entertainment', 'Technology', 'Science']","Media Companies, Seeing Profit Slip, Push Into EducationAs another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”As another academic year starts, about 500,000 children across the country will find themselves learning subjects like middle school history or high school biology from a new line of digital textbooks. These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

U.K. members of parliament (MPs) have called for the creation of  an artificial intelligence (AI) commission to examine the effect  new technologies will have on society.   ""Artificial intelligence has some way to go before we see systems  and robots as portrayed in the creative arts such as Star Wars,""  Tania Mathias, interim chair of the U.K. parliament's science and  technology select committee, said in a statement.   ""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.The U.K. is not ready for how artificial intelligence (AI) will  ""fundamentally reshape"" the way we live and work, lawmakers  warned in a report on Wednesday.

A man called the program and said that some of these surveys which claim scientific support for the global warming hypothesis, contained some decidedly unclimatolgical signatures from pediatricians, gynecologists or just about anybody else with a terminal degree. In other words the case against oil was a little slipperier than reported. “Gynecologists against drilling?”, I thought, “Seems like there must be some kind of conflict of interest here. I need to learn more.” Googling ‘gynecologist’ and ‘warming’ is an adventure in itself, but eventually I found a report by the National Center Policy Analysis which indeed found such signatures on a letter released by Ozone Action, and widely circulated in the media. (See Bowyer's take on oil in the video).Who am I to judge the scientific case for global warming? I have barely any more experience in climatology than I do in gynecology, although I am an eager student in both. However, it seems to me that the incredibly obvious point of weakness in the public policy argument is blindingly obvious.

""We really think this is a big idea...it's just the very, very  beginning of something we call ephemeral media, media you share  that disappears. So it's hard to say right now, but it's a really  big space and we look forward to exploring  it,"" Spiegel said.   For only being in the beginning stages, SnapChat certainly has a  large base of users.  The app, which enables users to send photos, videos or messages  that disappear 10 seconds after being viewed, has 1.7 million  monthly Facebook users with over 60 million 'Snaps' sent  daily.   (Read More: Facebook Is Giving  Away Free Mobile Data to Some Users )  SnapChat is working to tap into its growing reach and is  developing ways for companies to advertise on its picture-sharing  platform, said Spiegel.    ""There's a couple of things we are really excited about right  now. There are a lot of businesses experimenting with  SnapChat,"" Spiegel said. ""What I'm really excited about  is this really awesome new ad format we've been experimenting  with. We think it's really engaging. We think when ads are done  right, they can be informative and delightful and we are really  excited about that.""  Spiegel said that SnapChat is different from traditional  social media because its a medium people can use to show more  human moments.  (Read More: Facebook Is Tossing  Your Old Pics Into 'Cold Storage' )  ""Traditional social media is a place where people want to look  very cool,"" he said. ""SnapChat is really a place where our users  can send funny, interesting embarrassing photos.""  The app has gained a lot of attention recently for being a  popular way for youths to sext, or send inappropriate pictures of  themselves.   (Read More: Regretting That Sext  You Just Sent? There's an App for That )  Spiegel, however, said he discourages any user of SnapChat from  sending inappropriate image on the app.   ""SnapChat is not a great way to send inappropriate content  because any photo that I send to you can be saved by taking a  screenshot or by taking a photo with another camera. So it's not  a great way to send inappropriate photos,"" he said.The photo-messaging app SnapChat is just getting started in  erasable media, the company CEO Evan Spiegel said Monday on  CNBC's Squawk on the Street.
